# TODO APP 

I have created a user-friendly Todo application using React.js, which includes several essential features to enhance productivity. The app allows users to add new todo items through a straightforward form, view all added items in a dynamic list, and update existing todos with ease. Additionally, users can delete unwanted items, and toggle the completion status of each todo, marking them as either completed or pending. This comprehensive functionality ensures a smooth and efficient task management experience.

## Technologies used
1.react js \
2.Bootstrap and css for styling

 1. create a folder then in that folder clone the git url- git clone  https://github.com/pakkiankita/mytodoapp.git \

 4. 'npm start'
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in browser.
